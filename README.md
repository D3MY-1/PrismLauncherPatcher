# PrismLauncher Patcher (Portable Version Only)

This tool patches the **portable version** of the PrismLauncher executable (`prismlauncher.exe`) to enable offline account creation, eliminating the requirement for a Microsoft account. It generates a new executable file named `prismlauncher_patched.exe` within the same directory, leaving the original `prismlauncher.exe` untouched.

**Important: This tool right now works exclusively with the portable version of Prism Launcher.** It may not function correctly with installed versions.
