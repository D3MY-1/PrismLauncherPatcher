# PrismLauncher Patcher

This tool patches the PrismLauncher executable (`prismlauncher.exe`) to allow for offline account creation, bypassing the need for a Microsoft account.  It creates a new executable file named `prismlauncher_patched.exe` in the same directory, leaving the original `prismlauncher.exe` untouched.

**Disclaimer:** This tool modifies the PrismLauncher executable. Use it at your own risk.  While this patch aims to enable offline accounts, future PrismLauncher updates may break compatibility.  I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using this tool.  Please be aware of PrismLauncher's terms of service regarding modifications.

## How to Use

1. **Download:** Download the latest release of the PrismLauncher Patcher from the [Releases](https://github.com/D3MY-1/PrismLauncherPatcher/releases) page.

2. **Placement:** Place the downloaded `PrismLauncherPatcher.exe` file in the same directory as your `prismlauncher.exe`.

3. **Execution:** Run the `PrismLauncherPatcher.exe`.

4. **Result:** A new file, `prismlauncher_patched.exe`, will be created in the same directory.  This is your patched version of PrismLauncher.

5. **Usage:** Run `prismlauncher_patched.exe` instead of `prismlauncher.exe`. You should now be able to create offline accounts.
